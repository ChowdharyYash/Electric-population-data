## 🔬 Technical Highlights

### Data Quality Analysis & Cleaning
```python
# Intelligent zero handling based on column context
if 'Electric Range' in evp_data.columns:
    # For Electric Range, zeros are invalid - replace with vehicle-type specific median
    evp_data['Electric Range'] = evp_data['Electric Range'].replace(0, np.nan)
    
    # Impute based on vehicle type when possible
    for vtype in evp_data['Electric Vehicle Type'].unique():
        type_median = evp_data[
            (evp_data['Electric Vehicle Type'] == vtype) & 
            (evp_data['Electric Range'].notna())
        ]['Electric Range'].median()
```

### Feature Engineering
```python
# Calculate efficiency metrics
evp_data['Price per Mile'] = evp_data['Base MSRP'] / evp_data['Electric Range']

# Create efficiency rating categories
def get_efficiency_category(price_per_mile):
    if price_per_mile <= price_mile_quantiles[0]:
        return 'Excellent'
    elif price_per_mile <= price_mile_quantiles[1]:
        return 'Good'
    elif price_per_mile <= price_mile_quantiles[2]:
        return 'Average'
    else:
        return 'Below Average'
```

    Q3 = evp_data[col].quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    outliers_count = ((evp_data[col] < Q1 - 1.5*IQR) |
